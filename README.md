## Selected Projects

- [**Memphis - Listen. Feel. Create.**](https://fs-memphis.onrender.com) Music, reimagined. My goal is simple: turn **passive listening** into **active discovery** and make musical knowledge **accessible** to all. The approach combines **clear** musical mapping (instruments, keys, structure) with **insights** into streaming algorithms, alongside **tools** and guidance for anyone to create with **intention and purpose** (Node.js, Express, MongoDB, JWT, React).
